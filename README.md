# Example GitLab CI/CD Configuration

This is an example GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration file (gitlab-ci.yml) for a Python project. The pipeline includes stages for initialization, testing, and deployment. The pipeline uses various linters to validate the code, and generates linting badges as artifacts. The pipeline also includes a deployment stage that is currently empty, but can be customized to deploy the code to a server or other destination.
Pipeline Stages

The pipeline includes the following stages:

1. init: Initializes the Python environment by installing dependencies with pipenv. The virtual environment is cached to speed up future pipeline runs.
2. test: Runs linters to validate the code. The pipeline includes the following linters:
 * pylint: Analyzes Python code and generates a score based on code quality. The pipeline generates a badge for the score.
 * black: Formats Python code to adhere to a specific style guide.
 * isort: Sorts Python imports to follow a specific style guide.
3. deploy: An empty stage that can be customized to deploy the code to a server or other destination.

## How to Use

To use this GitLab CI/CD configuration in your project:

1. Copy the gitlab-ci.yml file to the root of your project directory.
2. Customize the stages and linters as needed.
3. Push the changes to your GitLab repository.
4. Set up a GitLab CI/CD runner to execute the pipeline.

That's it! Your project should now have a CI/CD pipeline that automatically validates the code and can deploy it to a server or other destination.
